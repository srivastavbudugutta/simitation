Description: Provides tools for generating and analyzing simulation studies.  Users may easily specify all terms of a simulation study, often in a single line of code.  Common univariate and bivariate methods, such as t tests, proportions tests, and chi squared tests, are integrated.  Multivariate studies involving linear or logistic regression may also be specified with symbolic inputs.  The simulation studies generate data for n observations in each of B experiments.  Analyses of each experiment are integrated, and empirical results across the experiments are also provided.
